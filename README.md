# Mappr

Hackathon project using [https://github.com/ProjectDent/ARKit-CoreLocation](ARKit+CoreLocation) by Project Dent, utilizing GPS coordinates associated with Flickr images to display photos in augmented reality in the location they were taken/posted.

Will be iterating on this example project a bit, starting with organizing the code a bit better so it's not all in the View Controller.

NOTE: You must get a Flickr API key [https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply](here) and paste it into the var at the top of ViewController.swift.
